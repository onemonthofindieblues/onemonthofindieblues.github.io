We do and have done a lot of things together, we talk everyday, video chat almost everyday, she writes notes and I read them everyday, we watched movies together (at the same time), we ate together, we worked out, and many other things. Yesterday and today we have been talking about making lists such as "Movies to watch", "Tasks", "Animes to watch",  and many others that she has in mind. 

The idea of making lists I think it is a great one for two reasons:
* Writing down ideas is the first and most important step to make them.
* It is a log, we can read it every time that we feel weak or sad, and we know that we have done so many things together and we had fun.     


It is like working out, first you make your  routine, it will change as you progress, and then you write down in a log your thoughts and progress so you can come back and read it every time you feel that you are not making any progress and say "Actually, I have improved a lot since ... ", or if you are not progressing you can trace and know what you are doing wrong  because of that log.

So... I am very excited about this idea of lists. I love her and doing things together make me really happy.
