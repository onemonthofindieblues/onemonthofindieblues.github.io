I remember that day  
The first time we have ever talked  
Handstands in San Marcos  
Lying on the floor lit by moonlight  
You face, your smile, your essence  
Cowboy sountrack as a background music  
Our first kiss  
The first time we had sex  

I remember that day in San Borja  
You on swing  
Eating turron  
Walking together as travelers  
Eating ice cream  

I remember that day in the gym  
The first time we slept together  
The warmth of your body  
The quietness of my heart  
Mandarina woke me up  

I remember that day  
You told that you love me  
You cuddle  
You cooked me  
You hold my hand  
You hug me as we were one  
Your smile before I left  

Te amo muchisimo
