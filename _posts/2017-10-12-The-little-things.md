I remember our first kiss. It was so soft, so gentle. It was a bit playful and sweet. I liked it a lot. 

I sometimes start having doubts, but then, I remember. I remember how much I like him. I love him, yes, but I liked him first.

I remember the little things that made me like him: the funny remarks, Cowboy Bebop, handstands, tickles, games, the harmonica. The little things that made me like him in a deeper way: his blog, his view of life, his treasure box, his background.The little things that made me feel attached to him: the day we spent trapped in an Indie movie, the swings, the ice cream, the way he looked at me, the way he spoke to me, the way he kissed me, the way he hugged me.

I remember the little things that made me realize I was in love with him: being apart for a week, feeling excited everytime I looked at him, everytime he looked at me. All the small moments we lived together: cooking, training, resting, walking, going to the supermarket, watching movies, eating picarones. I treasure them all.


I remember the little things that now make me feel how much I actively love him: the photos that he sends, the texts that he writes to me, the way he trains, the way he moves, the way he speaks, this blog, our lists, his clothes, the way he says he loves me. 

Itâ€™s the little things, because we are made of little things. And I love the little things that make him who he is. I love you.
