title: Hacking function main
category: programming
---

I found this [post](http://jroweboy.github.io/c/asm/2015/01/26/when-is-main-not-a-function.html) in which a guy, called James Rowe, successfully compiled a program in which he defined a variable called `main` and made it work as if there was an actually `int main(){...}`.  So, before I finished to read the whole post I decided to try it by myself. 

Last month I solved a `buffer bomb` similar to this one described [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-s02/www/applications/labs/lab3/buflab.html). Basically I used a [buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow) to write directly on specific memory locations.
The buffer overflow and my knowledge in linking, assembly and virtual memory gave me the confidence to try the something similar to James's post.


# The problem
I want to print on my screen `holi boli` by using a code in which I only declare and define a variable called `main`. *Note* this code only works on a x64 Linux machine 

You can find the programs I coded [here](https://github.com/daleonpz/blog/tree/master/_code).

# The result
I ended up with this code:
```c
const char main[] ={
  0x55,                   	
  0x48, 0x89, 0xe5,
  0xb8, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00 , 0x00,
  0xbb, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00 , 0x00,
  0xbe, 0x81, 0x05, 0x40 , 0x00,    	
  0xba, 0x0a, 0x00, 0x00 , 0x00,	
  0x0f, 0x05,
  0xb8, 0x3c, 0x00, 0x00 , 0x00,
  0x0f, 0x05
  // <message>
  0x68, 0x6f, 0x6c, 0x69, 0x20,
  0x62,
  0x6f,             
  0x6c,              
  0x69, 0x0a, 0xb8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x5d, 0xc3,
  0x0f, 0x1f, 0x84, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 	
  0x00 
};
```

Of course the output is `holi boli`.

# The process

## First attempt
The first thing I did was to code what I wanted to achieve.
```c
// baseline.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	printf("holi boli \n");
}
```

This code is straightforward. I compiled `gcc -W -Wall test1.c -o run` and I run `objdump -D run` to see what was the assembly code related to `main`.

```nasm
00000000004004f6 <main>:
  4004f6: 55                push   %rbp
  4004f7: 48 89 e5          mov    %rsp,%rbp
  4004fa: bf 94 05 40 00    mov    $0x400594,%edi
  4004ff: e8 ec fe ff ff    callq  4003f0 <puts@plt>
  400504: b8 00 00 00 00    mov    $0x0,%eax
  400509: 5d                pop    %rbp
  40050a: c3                retq   
  40050b: 0f 1f 44 00 00    nopl   0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
```

From now on I will only show the memory locations and opcode not the assembly instructions given by  `objdump -D`, unless it is necessary. 

Based on the concept behind buffer overflow, I can use `char` arrays to write directly into memory. Thus, I naively did the following:

```c
//test1.c
char main[] = { 0x55,
	0x48, 0x89, 0xe5,
	0xbf, 0x94, 0x05, 0x40, 0x00,
	0xe8, 0xec, 0xfe, 0xff, 0xff,
	0xb8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
	0x5d,
	0xc3,
	0x0f, 0x1f, 0x44, 0x00, 0x00,
};
```
I compiled and this happened `Illegal instruction (core dumped)`, a segmentation fault. It was kind of expected something similar so I used `objdump -D` to see what was under the hood.

```nasm
Disassembly of section .data:

0000000000601020 <__data_start>:
	...

0000000000601028 <__dso_handle>:
	...

0000000000601030 <main>:
  601030: 55            
  601031: 48 89 e5      
  601034: bf 94 05 40 00
  601039: e8 ec fe ff ff  callq  4003f0 <puts@plt>
  60103e: b8 00 00 00 00
  601043: 5d            
  601044: c3            
  601045: 0f 1f 44 00 00

```

The key word here is `.data`. Yes my friend, `main` in the `.data` section. For more information about ELF sections I wrote a post about [ELF files](https://daleonpz.com/blog/linking-basics). But if we wanted `char main` to work as if it were "true" code, `main` should be in `.text` section or `.rodata` section.

## Second attempt
I added `const` before `char main` to move from `.data` to `.rodata`.

```c
//test2.c
const char main[] = { 0x55,
	0x48, 0x89, 0xe5,
	0xbf, 0x94, 0x05, 0x40, 0x00,
	0xe8, 0xec, 0xfe, 0xff, 0xff,
	0xb8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
	0x5d,
	0xc3,
	0x0f, 0x1f, 0x44, 0x00, 0x00,
};
```

I run the code and I got `Illegal instruction (core dumped)`. Another infamous segmentation fault. 
And of course, as you was expected, I used `objdump -D`:

```nasm
Disassembly of section .rodata:

0000000000400530 <_IO_stdin_used>:
  400530:	01 00             
  400532:	02 00             
	...

0000000000400540 <main>:
  400540:	55                
  400541:	48 89 e5          
  400544:	bf 94 05 40 00    
  400549:	e8 ec fe ff ff   
  40054e:	b8 00 00 00 00    
  400553:	5d                
  400554:	c3                
  400555:	0f 1f 44 00 00  
```

Nothing seems to be wrong. So I used `baseline.c` to see what could happen, and I noticed this `4004ff:	e8 ec fe ff ff	callq  4003f0 <puts@plt>`. 
Let's check in which address is the GOT `.plt` for `printf` (`puts@plt`)... Oohhh shit!, obviously the linker didn't link `printf` since there is no reference to that function. Let's  try another approach :)


The GOT or _global offset table_ is used to link functions defined in shared libraries in such a way that instead of loading the whole library, the compiler only uses the function that have references in the code. To learn more you can google it. 
Maybe I will write a post about it, when it happens I will update this post.


The GOT `.plt` for `printf` in `baseline.c` is as follow:

```nasm
00000000004003f0 <puts@plt>:
  4003f0: ff 25 22 0c 20 00    jmpq   *0x200c22(%rip)     
                    ; 601018 <_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+0x18>
  4003f6: 68 00 00 00 00       pushq  $0x0
  4003fb: e9 e0 ff ff ff       jmpq   4003e0 <_init+0x18>
```

## Third attempt
I got stuck here, so I supposed that James had the same problem. I read a little more his post and he used a [syscall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call) to write on screen. I read this [post](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/), suggested by James, and followed the instructions.

System call used assembly instructions, I wrote an assembly program to see whether a `syscall` would help me. I ended up with the code `test3.c`. I added comments to make the code easy to understand.

```c
//test3.c
int main(){
    __asm__ (
        /* 1 is the syscall number to
        write on 64bit */
    "movl $1, %eax;\n"  
        /* 1 is stdout and is the 
        first argument */
    "movl $1, %ebx;\n"  
        /* load the address of string 
        into the second argument*/
    "movl $message, %esi;\n" 
        /* third argument is the length 
        of the string to print*/
    "movl $10, %edx;\n"  
    "syscall;\n"
    "movl $60,%eax;\n" // call exit
    "syscall;\n"
        /* Store the "holi boli\n" 
        inside the main function */
    "message: .ascii \"holi boli\\n\";"
    );
    return 0;
}
```

I compiled the code and guess what? it worked!!! It printed `holi boli` on the screen.

## Fourth attempt:
I used `objdump -D` to get the opcode:

```nasm
00000000004004a6 <main>:
  4004a6:    55                push   %rbp
  4004a7:    48 89 e5          mov    %rsp,%rbp
  4004aa:    b8 01 00 00 00    mov    $0x1,%eax
  4004af:    bb 01 00 00 00    mov    $0x1,%ebx
  4004b4:    be c7 04 40 00    mov    $0x4004c7,%esi
  4004b9:    ba 0a 00 00 00    mov    $0xa,%edx
  4004be:    0f 05             syscall 
  4004c0:    b8 3c 00 00 00    mov    $0x3c,%eax
  4004c5:    0f 05             syscall 
```

If you don't notice, the line `"movl $message, %esi;\n"` in `test3.c` has been replaced by `mov    $0x4004c7,%esi`. This means that the message `holi boli` is somewhere else, in this case the message starts at `0x4004c7`.

```nasm
00000000004004c7 <message>:
  4004c7:    68 6f 6c 69 20      
  4004cc:    62                  
  4004cd:    6f                  
  4004ce:    6c                  
  4004cf:    69 0a b8 00 00 00  
  4004d5:    00 5d c3            
  4004d8:    0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00
  4004df:    00 
```

I naively joined both parts as follows to see the new memory address where the message will be allocate.

```c
//test4.c
const char main[] ={
  0x55,                   	
  0x48, 0x89, 0xe5,
  0xb8, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0xbb, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0xbe, 0xc7, 0x04, 0x40, 0x00,    	
  0xba, 0x0a, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,	
  0x0f, 0x05,
  0xb8, 0x3c, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x0f, 0x05
  // <message>
  0x68, 0x6f, 0x6c, 0x69, 0x20,
  0x62,
  0x6f,               
  0x6c,                
  0x69, 0x0a, 0xb8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x5d, 0xc3,
  0x0f, 0x1f, 0x84, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 	
  0x00
};
```

The output was `SI��I��`. This means two things. First, I am doing a `syscall` and second, as I expected, the program is reading the wrong section.

# Success
With the help of `objdump` I get the correct memory address for the message.

```nasm
0000000000400560 <main>:
  400560:	55                  
  400561:	48 89 e5            
  400564:	b8 01 00 00 00      
  400569:	bb 01 00 00 00      
  40056e:	be c7 04 40 00      
  400573:	ba 0a 00 00 00      
  400578:	0f 05               
  40057a:	b8 3c 00 00 00     
    ; syscall  
  40057f:	0f 05           
    ; message
  400581:	68 6f 6c 69 20      
  400586:	62                  
  400587:	6f                  
  400588:	6c                  
  400589:	69 0a b8 00 00 00   
  40058f:	00 5d c3            
  400592:	0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00
  400599:	00 
```

So the new address is `0x400581`. I updated the code.

```c
const char main[] ={
  0x55,                   	
  0x48, 0x89, 0xe5,
  0xb8 , 0x01 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00,
  0xbb , 0x01 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00,
  // update of the address
  0xbe , 0x81 , 0x05 , 0x40 , 0x00,    	
  0xba , 0x0a , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00,	
  0x0f , 0x05 ,
  0xb8 , 0x3c , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00,
  0x0f , 0x05,
  // <message>
  0x68, 0x6f , 0x6c , 0x69 , 0x20 ,
  0x62,
  0x6f,               
  0x6c,                
  0x69 , 0x0a , 0xb8 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00,
  0x00 , 0x5d , 0xc3 ,
  0x0f , 0x1f , 0x84 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00, 0x00, 	
  0x00 
};
```
I run the last code and it was a success! Woo-hoo!

# Final thoughts
* It was tricky, but the basics will never betray you.
* I could use `gdb` to perform all the disassembles, but the code wasn't very long so `objdump` and `vim` made the magic for me.
