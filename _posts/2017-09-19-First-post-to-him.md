It has been six days since he left. It's not my first time trying to commit to a relationship, but it is the first time doing it while being in love. And that changes things. It changes how motivated I am, how little I have to constantly convince myself that this is a good decision and how willing I am to wait. Just wait.

On the downside, it also changes how scared I am to do and lose some things. But the fear is not a paralyzing one. It is actually kind of motivating. I think this is in part due to the fact that I'm older now. I understand more things (or rather, accept more things as they are) and no longer have the urge to know or the creeping anxiety about the (possibly wrong path to the) future.

I think about him everyday. I wake up and go to sleep with him everyday. And when I go on doing my daily activities, I evoke him and he is with me there. Specially when working out. Iâ€™ve been wearing at least one item of his everyday. Every time I remember, it makes me smile.

One month. That's all it took. I suppose it took even less than that. But one month is what we got. And we used it the best way we could. We were pretty good at it. I'm really happy about how everything came to be. Of course there is that little annoying know-it-all-voice in my head that makes fun of how little time it took. It can't be that good for such a little time. But hey, I am sure that most people couldn't achieve in a year what we did in a month. Or two weeks, for that matter. 

I felt he was special from the very first, but I did not trust that simple judgement. I needed not to just feel but know it. And I got to know him. I remember how the more I knew about him, the more I wanted to know and be with him. I never really had doubts about that. Everything felt quite natural. Even planning our future together felt as a  perfectly natural way to continue our conversations. I'm really happy about that. 

I write to him everyday. We talk. We share our days. I still get sad sometimes. At least a couple of minutes everyday. But most of the time I am at ease. I have trust. I have love. I have him.
