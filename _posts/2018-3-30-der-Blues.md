We spent a bit more than a month together. Really together. Again, I feel as if we somehow managed to experience in one month what would usually take much more time. When I'm with him, I feel at ease. We never get tired of each other. 

When I first arrived, I was scared. I was a bit confused and feared that our feelings had washed away. This fear dissolved in time. I now feel that our relationship is strong and will stand through anything.

Now we will be apart again, but we know we'll be together soon. We have to work things out.

I love you.

Beshito, beshito, beshito.
