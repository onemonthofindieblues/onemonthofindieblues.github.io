I have fear that everything is going to end. I made a mistake and for the first time I am afraid. Not only because she may break up with me, but also in case she won't do it, I will be afraid of doing things due to the fact that I wouldn't fuck up again.

There is nothing else I can do. I looked at her photos many times throughout the day. I love her and she is the most important person in my life. I was selfish and I crossed the line with my jokes. I am sorry...

De verdad te amo con todo mi coraz√≥n.
