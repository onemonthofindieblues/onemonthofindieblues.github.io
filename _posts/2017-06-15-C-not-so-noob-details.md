title: Details of C that every not so noob forgets
category: programming
---

I already wrote a post about [Details of C that every noob forgets](https://daleonpz.com/blog/C-noob-details). In this post I will write about more advanced details. I hope this will improve your understand of the obscure C. By the way, for the a complete review I recommend to read [Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Programming-Peter-van-Linden/dp/0131774298/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1497536153&sr=8-1&keywords=expert+C) by  Peter van der Linden or my [notes](https://github.com/daleonpz/Notes/blob/master/Books/Expert-C-programming.md).

# WTF? `const` is not constant
The keyword `const` doesn't mean _constant expression_ , it only gives the status of **read-only**.

```c
const int two=2;

switch (i) {
    /*case const-expr: statements*/
     case 1: printf("case 1 \n");
     case two: printf("case 2 \n");
**error** ^^^ integral constant expression expected
     case 3: printf("case 3 \n");
     default: ; }
```

# Typedef vs macros
Even though they might look the same, these guys are totally different.

```c
#define type1 int

typedef  int type2;

int main(){

    type1 a; // works
    type2 b; // works

    unsigned type1 c; // works
    unsigned type2 d; // illegal
}
```

`typedef` defines a new data type, while `#define` is just a replacement. 
For example `typedef  int type2;` means that `type2` is **int**, whereas `#define type1 int` means that `type1` will be replaced by `int` every time it appears in the code. 
Thus, you can even to the following:

```c
#define type1 int
typedef  type1 type2;
```

Again `#define` does not define a new data type.

```c
#define int_ptr int *
int_ptr a,b; 
/*
 this means:
  int *a, b;
 which is different from
  int *a, *b;
*/
```

# Do not self-deSTRUCT
I used to make this mistake when I was learning C. Be careful when using `typedef` with `struct`.

```c
// struct with foo as a tag
struct foo{
    int a;
    char b;
};

// foo1 is a struct foo
typedef struct foo{
    int a;
    char b;
} foo1;
```

Check the following statements:
```c
foo a;  // illegal
// there is not 'foo' type 
struct foo a; // good
foo1 a; // good
struct foo1 a; // illegal
// foo1 is already a data type
```

# EPIC BATTLE: arrays vs pointers

## Accessing data from array is different if we use pointers.

```c
char a[5] = "abcd";
c = a[2];

/*
in symtab: a is on 0x4000 
a = | a | b | c | d | '\0' |
*/
```

If we want to access the third element `a[2]`
1. 0x4000 + 2 , directly!!
2. get value from 0x4002 

```sh
0x0000000000400509 main+19 movzbl -0x1e(%rbp),%eax
0x000000000040050d main+23 mov    %al,-0x1(%rbp)
```

In case of pointers:
```c
char *p = a;
c = *(p+2);
```
To access the third element:
1. get address of p
2. p+2
3. get value from that address

```sh
0x000000000040052d main+55 mov    -0x10(%rbp),%rax
0x0000000000400531 main+59 movzbl 0x2(%rax),%eax
0x0000000000400535 main+63 mov    %al,-0x1(%rbp)
```

## The array definition will allocate N bytes, whereas a pointer definition will only allocate a word size.

```c
int m[3];
/* sizeof(m) = 12 */
int *p;
/* sizeof(p) = 8 (CPU of 64 bits)*/
```

Another example:

```c
char a[] = "hallo";
char *b  = "hallo";
```

`a[]` is an array that holds `{'h','a','l','l','o','\0'}`, and it can be modified. 
`*b` is a pointer to a read-only section that holds `"hallo"`.

One last example:
```c
int main(){
    // an array 
    char a[] = "hola";

    // a pointer 
    char *b;

    // a pointer to read-only memory
    char *c = "hallo";

    // b can point to a or c
    b = c;
    b = a;

    // c can point to a or c
    c = a;
    c = b;

    // but a cannot point to a or c, 
    // because it is not a FUCKING POINTER!!!!!

    a = b;
   // error: assignment to expression with array type   a = b;

}
```
## When an array is a pointer
Declarations themselves can be further split into three cases: 
- declaration of an external array `extern char a[];`. `a` cannot be rewritten as a pointer.
- definition of an array (remember, a definition is just a special case of a declaration; it 
allocates space and may provide an initial value). `char a[10];`. `a` cannot be rewritten as a pointer.
- declaration of a function parameter `int function ( char a[]); `. `a` is rewritten as a pointer whether you like it or not.

```c
void my_function_1( int a [2][3][5] ) { ; }  
void my_function_2( int a [][3][5] ) { ; }  
void my_function_3( int (*a)[3][5] ) { ; }  
 

int main(){
    int arr[2][3][5];  

    my_function_1( arr );  
    my_function_2( arr );  
    my_function_3( arr );  

    int (*p) [3][5] = arr;  

    my_function_1( p );  
    my_function_2( p );  
    my_function_3( p );

    int (*q)[2][3][5] = &arr;

    my_function_1( *q );
    my_function_2( *q );
    my_function_3( *q );
}
```

In summary, the rule *array name is rewritten as a pointer argument* isn't recursive. An array of arrays is rewritten as a *pointer to arrays* **NOT** as a *pointer to pointer*. 

Thus, 
- array of array `char a[9][4]` can be rewritten as `char (*a)[4]` pointer to array
- array of pointers `char *a[4]` can be rewritten as `char **a` pointer to pointer
- pointer to array `char (*a)[4]` is `char (*a)[4]` pointer to array
- pointer to pointer `char **a` is `char **a` pointer to pointer


The very common case is the `main` function:

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv){}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){}
```

# Just for fun
Read the following one-liner:
```c
main() { printf(&unix["\021%six\012\0"],(unix)["have"]+"fun"-0x60);}`
```

David Korn wrote this one-liner and won the [iocc contest](http://www.ioccc.org/years.html#1987_korn) in 1987

Try to understand yourself the code, there are some extra info you might need:
* `unix` is a predefined macro with value 1 `#define unix 1`
* `a[i]` is resolved by the compiler as `*(a+i)`
* `a[i][j]` is resolved by the compiler as `*( *(a+i) + j)`

# Last words
C is a very simple language if you compare to python or even c++, and still very powerful. I hope you enjoy all the information provided here. Let me know if you have some questions.

Have fun!
