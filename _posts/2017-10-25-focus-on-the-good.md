Focus on the good, but keep in mind the bad. For that is most likely what your problems be about.

Focus on the smiles, but remember the tears.

Focus on the feeling, but use the thinking that goes along. 

Focus on his beauty, but love all of his parts.

Focus on what you share, but enjoy what makes you different.

Focus on the compliment, but listen to the criticism.

Focus on your strength, but strengthen your weaknesses.

Focus on forever, but remember impermanence.
