I tried doing kongs today. I'm still pretty bad at it. I wished he had been  there to teach me how to do that well. I feel as if he would teach things the right way. 

I've been really cold today. More than usual. I read a bit, trained a bit, ate a lot, missed him in uneven ways. Most of the time I don't really feel I miss him. It feels as if he were really close and I could reach up to him if I wanted to. But then everything gets quiet and I notice he is not. And then I miss him. And boy, how I miss him. I am not used to missing (nor to being missed). I think itâ€™s overall a good thing. It reminds me of how much I can really feel, how much I can really care, because caring is important. But then again, he is in a way, just not physically (and physically is important).

I think I have it easier. I stayed, he left. I kept the familiar people and places. I'm still at home and have the comfort of familiarity. He's in a new place, with new people, new language and new culture. I sometimes worry. It's kind of a silly worry.  Not that something bad is going to occur to him, but that, even though I am sure everything is gonna turn out fine at the end, at some point along the way, things may look pretty bad. 

We videochat. We've done so for the past few days. I enjoy just looking at him and hearing his voice. I love his facial expressions, especially his smile. It comforts me in a way. If I cannot cuddle with his body (and I love his body), I will cuddle with his smile. 

We write. I love that we write. I like writing to him. I like that he writes. I'm a bit old fashioned in that sense. I'm thankful for the technology that allows real-time communication, but writing down our thoughts seems pretty adequate to our situation. I sometimes find myself composing a letter in my head while I walk; describing my feelings and situation.
