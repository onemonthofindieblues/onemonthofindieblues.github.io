In the last couple of days I have been under stress, my ankle still hurts, I am sick, my german sucks and still a lot paperwork to do. Sometimes, I regreted about being here, not only because of all the things I've mentioned but also because I am not with her and I am still not sure about my studies.
I did really like my lifestyle: working for a few hours, training a lot, be with her. But now, all have changed. I cannot even train, my body hurts so bad.

Maybe it is a bit selfish, but I do really need her. I have to overcome this emotional dowside and keep strong for both... I need to breath and keep focused.

Everything it's gonna be alright!
