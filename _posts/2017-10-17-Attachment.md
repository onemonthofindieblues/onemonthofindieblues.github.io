I  got a bit drunk yesterday. I met some people and had fun talking about nerdy stuff. For moments, during the whole event, I was trying to picture him there with me. Sometimes it made sense, sometimes it didn’t. He doesn’t have to go with me to places he doesn’t want to. But I think most places would be a lot more fun to be if he’s there with me. 

Around 10 pm (my 10 pm), I thought he might be awake so I started texting him. Not continuously, I was still interacting with people, but from time to time, I felt the need to tell him how much I loved him. That, and send pictures of the place.

Around 1 am, when I was finally alone, returning home, I started feeling that I really wanted to be with him. But I didn’t get sad; in fact, I realized that it’s been a while since the last time I got sad. Now it was just the feeling of missing him and wanting to hug him and kiss him and be by his side, but no sadness derived from that. I think this may be partially due to the fact that now we have a date in which we will see each other again; it’s no longer uncertain, and that gives up something to look up to. It may also be that we finally got used to be physically apart. We videochat almost everyday and talk over Whatsapp all day. That’s the part that made me realize how attached I am to him: I write to him first thing in the morning and last thing before going to sleep, I wait for the videochat in excitement, I get really happy when he sends pictures, and while he’s sleeping, I sometimes re-read parts of the chat or look at his photos from the day. I also write to him during my afternoon and keep him on my mind when going. And I think that if he were here, we wouldn’t chat that much (or who knows) and we definitely wouldn’t videochat, but we would see each other a lot. I wonder if I would feel the same level of attachment. I’ve never been this attached to anybody, and I don’t think is a bad kind of attachment. I can completely live without him, but I think my life is better shared with his.

Today when I woke up, I felt I missed him a lot. But still no sadness appeared. I just somehow wished he were by my side. But he’ll soon be. And we’ll be fine. 


I love you.
