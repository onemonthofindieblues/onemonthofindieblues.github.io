We had a major discuss few days ago about if this relationship may or not last. I had doubts, she had her own doubts and concerns... I believe it is normal to think that something bad may happen or about the fear that all you love may end. However, she talked to me and I read her everyday notes for me and then I realized that we are pretty close.  We talk everyday, she writes me notes, I send her pictures, we truly say "I love you" and we think about the other in our everyday activities.

Since then, I am feeling pretty strong about our relationship and I try to support her now I am feeling  like this. Sometimes she overthinks, then she starts having negative thoughts and her mood changes, so I tried to keep her in the present where everythings actually happens. 

I love you so much!
