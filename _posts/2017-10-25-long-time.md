Long time I don't write something to her. In the last two weeks we had small fights that we successfully overcome. I've had classes and I've been studying a lot, so I didn't have a moment to write something. It has been a hard week, I sit all the day and it damages my back. Thus, I wasn't in a good mood. 

Anyway, I think a lot about her. I don't very comfortable knowing, or thinking, that she is not comfortable or under stress. She is not getting enough sleep, not working out as often as she used to do, living in a place that I think she is not feeling that good. It is my perception and she is a grown woman but still... I don't  want her to live in that way, I know that in general living  is not easy, but if I can do something to improve her quality of live (peaceful place at least) I will do it. I love her and I want the best for her.

I hope we can live together soon, we share routines and customs. We sleep and wake up early, we train, we have almost the same standards of cleanliness, we both sleep on the floor and many others. Also, we talked a lot about living together and we prevented some problems such as: each one will have  his/her own toothpaste, room, we set bathroom rules, eating rules, training rules. Basically we try to have everything well defined to avoid stupid problems. Thus, I believe we will live together  smoothly.
