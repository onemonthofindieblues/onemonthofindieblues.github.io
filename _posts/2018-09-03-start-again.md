I feel really confident about our relationship. In the  last month we've been together we fought, we trained, we cooked a lot and we saw each other almost everyday.
It was tough, but we made it this far.
Now everything starts again, we are far but I believe that we will make it again. 

I really like the cup she gave me.. I didn't use cups, but I will use this one everyday. I love her and I'll try my best to make it work.
