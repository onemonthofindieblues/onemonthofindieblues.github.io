We don't talk as we used to. We haven't video chatted in a while and we text less now. He doesn't tell me much about his life and I try to still write after he's gone to sleep, but I now doubt that he really cares that much.

I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. I'm trying to not draw any conclusions from it. But it does feel weird. I guess this is how a normal relationship evolves over time. I always feared being in one of those relationships in which people don't ever talk or share things. It repels me. 
I also haven't really ever been in a relationship as long as to see the evolution of it. 

We'll see.
