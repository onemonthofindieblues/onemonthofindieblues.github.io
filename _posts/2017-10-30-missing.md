I’ve been listening to “sad” music today. It feels nice. Comforting. It’s been a long time since the last time I felt really sad about us. I miss him, I miss him a lot, but I don’t feel sad anymore. 

I remember the last time we saw each other in “real time”, it was in the airport. He was going into the control area, where visitors cannot cross anymore, and he was walking down one of those zigzag lines; we had already said goodbye and I had turned my back at him, but then, without thinking, I turned around and at the same time he was just looking in my direction, and we locked eyes and smiled. And I felt really good and at ease, and as if it was suddenly clear that we were going to be together and everything would be alright.

We have had a couple of fights and misunderstandings, but now I feel we are really strong, that our relationship will thrive.

Today he took me for a walk via video chat, and it was fun. We talk everyday, about anything, everything. I really like that. I don’t think there’s something I couldn’t tell him about, no matter how stupid it sounds. I like that about him, about us.

I miss him. I miss him a lot. But I feel really close to him and I feel really confident that we will be fine. 

Te amo.
