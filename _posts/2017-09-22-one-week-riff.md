It has been a week since I arrived here to start a new life. In retrospective I haven't done that much, I visited a friend of mine in Hamburg, did my paperwork and pretty much that was all I did, besides the video chats and messages with her. 
It feels weird, but in a good manner... Even though, I cannot be with her physically I felt her very close to me.  

There are many ways to feel a person close. I heard once that you don't miss the person, you miss the experiences you used to have with that person. Maybe, it is something similar the other way around. For example, every time I wear her scarf, watch our videos, view our photographs, cook the food we used to cook, listen the music we used to listen and so on. Somehow, my mind brings her next to me as she were here with me doing all that stuff, having fun and looking her lovely smile that I love so much. 

It is cliche (fucking Hollywood, TV) but my home is whenever she is with me. I can be myself with her... I love her, and I was lucky to meet her before I left the country.

See you somewhere soon!
