It's been a month since the last time I posted here. I didn't realize. I was just reading his old posts and then opened my list of posts and saw the date of the last one. I wasn't expecting that.

I still write to him almost every day. I tell him about my day and about the ideas that come to my mind. I also send him pictures of the relevant (and irrelevant) events in my day. I think about him first thing in the morning and last thing at night. I love him so much.

I do feel as difference in how I feel about him. I don't feel the need to think about him that much, although I do feel the need I at least see a pic of him every couple of days. I don't have as many sexual thoughts and I don't feel like watching his photos over and over as I used to. 

I don't think this means I love him any less. I think it just means that time has passed, and the fact of not being physically together has an impact. 

I sometimes wonder how would it be when we're finally together. I'm a bit scared, a bit excited, a bit worried. Whatever the outcome, I know it will be alright. I also know that I have to really believe and really give it my best or it won't be any good. 

I miss you. I love you. I am with you.
