First post of the year...  
This week we had two "fights". I think they weren't proper fights, I think we just felt alone and missed the other that we became too sensitive to loneliness.
There is no day that I don't count how many days left to see each other again. 

I miss her, and I want to be with her ... sometimes I really need to feel her warm.
