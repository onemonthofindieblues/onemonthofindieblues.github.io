It has been five days since I came to Germany, it is not first time living abroad neither the first time having a long distance relationship. However, it is still hard not to miss her, it doesn't mean that I don't want to, but it just hurts and I know that it's okay but still. 
I love her, I am 100% commitment to this relationship, I do really have faith in us. We are not anymore the stupid kids we were... we are still doing stupid things but we are more mature.
 
It is cold here, and I feel lonely sometimes... I am still wearing the scarf she gave me, it feels as she were here hugging and protecting me. Suddenly, the weather doesn't feel that cold and I don't feel alone anymore . 

I love her, I really do. We have been together for a short time, but the quality of the time we spent together was high. I feel really connected to her, we are similar in several aspects and we share ideas that I think are  important for a long term relationship. She knows what I am talking about. However, I can say that the most important thing for me is that she is open minded, physically strong, independent and very intelligent, I believe that she is way smarter than me... and that's okay. And of course, she is the most sexiest woman I have ever met (I may jizz in my pants). 

These last five days we have been talking a lot, online and offline, she also wrote me everyday. Somehow, it feels really good when I read her messages and letters, maybe it is because I feel as she were here with me talking to me. 

Everything is gonna be alright!
