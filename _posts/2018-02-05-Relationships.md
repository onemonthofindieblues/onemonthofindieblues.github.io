When we started "dating" we said that each one will have a room, and whenever we wanted to sleep together, we would do it.
Also, we said that we would have our training room, but it didn't mean that we should train together always.
Now that we are not together in a physical way, it doesn't mean that we must talk everyday to each other.

I think that being together as a couple doesn't mean be together and talk to each other all the time.
I think it's more about taking care of each other and giving some space as well. 

ich liebe dich!
