I was listening to "Enanitos Verdes" and the song she send me "Quedate en Madrid", and I started to remember all the places we were, and used to go. Suddenly, I felt this uneasy feeling in my stomach. I want her to be with me here. I miss her so much.

I don't care where we are as long as we are together.
