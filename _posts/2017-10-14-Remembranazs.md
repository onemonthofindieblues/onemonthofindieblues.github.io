We had a fight yesterday and I know that I hurt her. I have an issue, when I feel that I am getting frustrated and sick of something I just want to escape looking for some "peace". When in reality I don't to escape, because I know that it's part of the game. You won't be happy always, life sucks, she is not perfect and she will make mistake, and the same applies to me. However, I want to be with her forever, she makes me happy, she is an incredible person and she made me a better person.  I have faith in us, we talk a lot about us and we are committed one hundred percent. We know we must work hard to make our relation work, we are couple and a team. 

It's been a month since I left. We have done so many things, and talked about so many topics. I am still remember the first time I saw her, her expressions and how she looked and  our first kiss. We have written about us, this blog is a prove of that and I think that writing had a huge impact in our relationship in the sense that helped us to keep our closeness. 

 We are strong, we love  and respect each other. It is not going to be easy, but I know that everything is going to be alright. I am really happy to be with her, I was lucky to meet her just before I left. 

 Te amo.
