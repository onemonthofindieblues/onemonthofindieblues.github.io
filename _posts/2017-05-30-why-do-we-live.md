title: Why do we live?
category: randomthought

I ask myself this question at least once every year. 
So far, I couldn't find a satisfactory answer.
However, for the last 2-3 days I've reading the manga "Alice in Borderland", and it reminded me the following statement.

```

Don't try to understand the meaning of life, it is pointless.
There wasn't a specific reason behind our birth, we are just
here. 

```

In the end, it is not about how long you can live, it is about how well you lived. 
Live on your own terms. In my case these are mye principles:

* Live in the present, it is the only moment that I can do something. 
* Avoid boredom. Feel alive, I am here to enjoy this game called life.
* Shit happens, so laugh.
* Be in peace with myself. I am the only person with whom I will be my whole life.


```

If you still unsatisfied with the life, well just say "fuck everything, let's smoke some weed and chill out!"
