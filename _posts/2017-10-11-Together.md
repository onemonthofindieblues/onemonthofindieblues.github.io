She booked a flight to Europe to visit me and travel together. I helped her with some options or possible routes we could go.
Anyway, she did the payment and when she told that she has already paid the ticket I was so excited and happy like a kid waiting for his Christmas present. It's only four more months and we will see each other in person again. 

I love her so much that I couldn't hold me excitement... I want to hug her, kiss her and look at her smile.
