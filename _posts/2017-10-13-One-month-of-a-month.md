He hurt my feelings today. We had an argument that felt to me as if it were going nowhere. And then as if it we were going to break up. But we got out of it. Not without harm. 

I thought about the following metaphor (which I don't remember if I got from him orr or if I heard it somewhere else or maybe I just thought of it):  a relationship is like the painted wall of a room, it will eventually wear out if you use the room. It depends on how you use it, but it will wear out nonetheless. However, this doesn't mean you should just go and scrap the wall because 'it will eventually be worn out’. It means you take care of it. And it doesn't mean you cover it all up or avoid using the room because you don't want it to wear out. It means you take care of it. The more busy the room, the more it wears out, but the more it was worth it. 

2. It's been a month since he went away. By now, we have been physically apart more than we've been together. But we know we'll be together soon. And then apart again. And then together again. And in the meantime, together all the time.

3. My biggest fear is still myself. I get negative thoughts, camouflaged as 'rational thinking’. So, what am I usually running away from when facing a serious relationship?:
Loss of liberty.
‘Fake’ emotions. 
 'waste of time’
I could develop each point but it'll be pointless (...). I do feel that those points are not part of this relationship, although there's a little voice at the back of my head who's not so sure. And that's ok. My doubts will always be there. Just like other thoughts that are always there and confuse me from time to time in other areas. I just have to deal with them

4. I do feel protected. And that's important. I want to feel protected and I want to protect him. 

5. I find him so very attractive. 

6. "If you're afraid to fall, you fall because you are afraid."

7. I choose to believe.
