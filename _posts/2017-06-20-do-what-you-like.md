How  would be the world if people just work on what they like, regardless the money they could earn, their academic background or connection that could make "easier" their life?
I know that money is important, but it shouldn't be the motivation behind your job.

I was reading a Wikipedia article about the game *Dwarf Fortress*, it says that its developers are making a living based on donations. 
Then I realized that Wikipedia is  also supported by donations.
And few seconds later, I started looking for projects that are supported by donations... And guess what... There are tons of them, and the people behind them put all their heart and effort to create this amazing projects.


So it seems that doing what you want have some chances to pay off.
