If there’s no trust, there’s no real relationship.

We almost come to an end. I would have been fine. Any outcome would have been just fine. But we decided to stay together. I think I overreacted, but it’s what I felt so I stand behind it. I validate my own feelings. 

Now I feel there is a breach in our trust, and we are rebuilding it, I really think we’ll be ok, but I need the trust. I need to trust him, and I need him to trust me. In the little things, in the big things, in all the things. If there’s no trust, there is no real relationship, only a game of people who will eventually get tired of playing and guessing. And I want none of that. 

I love him, and I trust him, and I trust us. Not completely, sometimes, but it will get there.

Te amo.
