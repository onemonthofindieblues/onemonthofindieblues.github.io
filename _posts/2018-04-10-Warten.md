Five months. He will come in five months. For a month.

I felt really happy when he told me. I felt five months were nothing. It felt as if five months would pass really fast and we would see each other really soon. But then, I noticed it was also five months the last time, so, what had changed? My guess: certainty.

For once, even though we felt really in love and committed last time, now we know (or at least I think we know) it will work. The small portion of “realistic doubts” has disappeared. After spending a second month together, our relationship has grown a lot, so this time five months don’t feel that bad.

There is also an element of certainty for me in a different way: last time I was in the middle of a lot of uncertain things in my life, and knowing him (and falling for him) only contributed somehow to that feeling. Now, I have made my mind over all of those things, so, even though there are many paths to follow, I already know what I should do. 

This is not to say that I don't miss him a lot. I think about him everyday and long for his company, but I feel at ease. Last time, I used to get really sad, especially at night, especially when completely alone. This time, I feel I miss him a lot, and still get a bit sad now and then, but keep a positive attitude overall.


I wait with a smile.

I love you.
