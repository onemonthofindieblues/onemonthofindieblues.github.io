We have spent more time separate than together, but I feel as we were together a lot of time. On the other hand, our time being apart doesn't feel that long. The brain saves experiences, so I think that since in Peru we spent so much time doing several thing and walking around that in my memories that interval of time is longer.

Anyway, I feel that our relationship is strong and stable. A few more months and we will be together again.
