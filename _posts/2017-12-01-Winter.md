It's finally winter in Germany, cold Germany.  Das sch√∂ne deutsche Wetter... Anyway, it is cold and many times I remembered how warm it felt sleeping by her side.
I also think that when she visits me, she should wear several layers of clothes because she, as well as me, is very cold sensitive. 
We have some plans for die Weihnnacht.
It is most likely we will have dinner/lunch together and gift exchange.

It's gonna be a cold winter, but when I think in her it doesn't feel that cold.
