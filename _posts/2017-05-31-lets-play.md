We as humans are meant to enjoy our life, and embrace death. 
We as society are wasting our time if we are not focusing on living through experiences.  
For example we do really love the thrilling  moments that fill our blood with adrenaline.

Thus, I invite you to see the world as if it were a game. 
Play with people, with the system rules, with your own life. 
Just have fun living because sooner or later we all be dead.
