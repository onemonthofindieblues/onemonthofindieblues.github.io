I feel really good about our relationship. I feel I want to commit and trust. I feel I want him trust in me. I don't need him, but I want to be with him. Always. 

Always… I used to dislike that word. I used to run away from that word. I used to hate that people pretended it was a real thing. And it's not that I now see that “always” is something really reasonable to expect, it's that “always” is what it feels like. It feels like always. And always comes with nuances.

I once read that if you want a long term relationship to work, you have to lose some inhibitions: fart, burp, vomit (when necessary). This was because at some point of your relationship you may encounter a tough time due to a disease, an accident or some other thing, and you may back away or feel it worse than it is if you don't have that feeling of being so close and comfortable with each other.

I think we have that covered. I feel really comfortable with him. More comfortable than with anybody. I feel that we have reached a good stance, and I hope we go further, as far as we can.

I love you.
