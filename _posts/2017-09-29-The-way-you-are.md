Would you love me if I get fat?

I once saw a comic strip in which a married couple were sitting on the couch watching tv together. The woman was with her head lying on her husband’s belly, which was a bit big. The man then noticed that he was fat (at least in the belly) and said something along the lines of “I have to get rid of this” (referring to belly fat). The woman then answers back by saying something like “You’re perfect just the way you are, and your belly is really comfy” and then they smiled and continued with their lives (their fake comic-strip lives). 

I saw that before knowing him, when I was on my own, and I thought “That’s messed up. How can the woman not support the man’s desire to be fitter and healthier? This ‘acceptance’ thing is going too far. She should not accept him if he could do better”. Loving someone just the way they are is ok, but not wanting them to improve themselves is wrong (to me), and letting someone you love to stop caring for themselves is also wrong. If you love someone, and that person starts becoming “worse off”, your feelings should also change.

And now, with him in my life, I checked if I still belive that. And I do. 

I love him for who he is, and he is someone who takes care of himself. He is someone who takes care of his body and tries to improve himself. I love his body. I find him very attractive, he is the most attractive person to me right now. I would choose his body over all others. And I think I will love his body through the years as long as he takes care of it. And of course it will change, but I think I will love him nonetheless. But then, what if he stops taking care of himself, if he lets go. That would have very superficial consequences, but I think it would have a deeper meaning. I think the body is important. I think the mind is important. I think there's no “true self” we should consider on top of other aspects. And taking care oneself is very important.

Would you love me if I get fat? Please don't. Please push me so I get back to being my self. And by 'fat’ I mean all of those deviations that make me worse off. Don't love if I'm fat, don't love me if I don't want to train. Don't love me if I stop learning, if I don't want to know more. Don't love if I lose my sense of humor, if I become cranky and tedious. Don't love me if I start smoking, drinking or doing some heavy drugs. Don't love me if I stop enjoying life and smiling at you, if I become dull and boring. Don't love me if I'm mean to you, if I'm unnecessarily mean to others. Don't love me if I change for worse in any way. Or, at least, love me less. Support my change. I will support yours. 

I love you just the way you are, and the way you are is constantly changing, for better. And I'll love you all the way.
