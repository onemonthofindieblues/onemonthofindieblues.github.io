I sarted checking aome job possibilities and it looks promising. I can teach a number of things as a private tutor (so no paper work) or apply for a formal job (paperwork...)
I feel quite excited now. It's less than a month away. We'llfinally be together again.

We don't videochat anymore. It doesn't feel wrong, but I'm curious as to why we stopped doing it so naturally. I hope it's because we know we'll see each other in person, and not because we grew tires of seeing and talking to each other
I feel we've come a long way and we are really going to make this happen.

Te amo much√≠simo.
