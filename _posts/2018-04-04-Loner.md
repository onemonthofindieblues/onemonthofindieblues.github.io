I'm a loner.

I still consider myself as someone who would usually rather be alone. This is especially important when choosing a place to live. Last year I decided to live with some friends in their parkour gym (to help them with the rent, and to use the gym). That was fun, but got to be quite stressful, particularly in the last months, when I could barely get some good sleep. And the constant interactions with people stressed me a lot. In general, having to interact too many times or for too long with people wears me out.

Now, I'm living in a friend's apartment, with 3 other people. They are usually out of the house, so I get the place to myself for most of the day. And I like that. I like not having to talk to anybody, not having to see anybody or interact in anyway. I've spent long periods of my life in similar situations, and I really enjoy that.

But with him, it's different.

We spent a month together. Together almost all day, everyday. It never became stressful or boring. We used to talk a lot, but also just be together, each doing their own thing, but together. 

That reinforced the notion of how special he is. I had never been that comfortable with anybody before. Ever. He's definitely the one I want to spend my days with. Talking, joking, caressing, or just being in the company of each other.

I love you.

Siempre.
