It feels as we were not writing here anymore. The days feels so long that I have been 3 days since my last post but somehow it feels as it were way more. If we were a sine signal, I think we would be in the part where the derivative is positive. 

We started sending more pictures and smiling more in the video chats, I think little things make our relation stronger and more stable. So what are the things that I believe that have made our relation better, stronger and more stable:

* To say a sincere "I love you" everyday.
* To say how much we like each other.
* To send us pictures.
* To write to each other (notes, this blog).
* To have our soundtrack.
* To smile during our video calls.
* To say "Good night" and "Good morning" everyday.
* To wear others clothes ( sweaters, scarfs).
* To do the things we used to together (cooking, training).
* To talk every time we feel that something is wrong.
* To discuss about several topics.

There should be more but those are the ones that came to my mind. I miss her, but I know we are very close.
