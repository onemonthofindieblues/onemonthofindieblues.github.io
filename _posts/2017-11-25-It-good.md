I think it doesn't feel that hard to wait until the next time we see each other. 
I think that our relationship have gotten quiet strong. We have overcome several mini and a few not so little fights, we talked about and solved them. 
So I think next time we see each other will be super exciting, and I pretty sure that we will feel that strange thing in the stomach. 
Anyway, I love her a lot.. for real, and I am happy to be with her.
