Yesterday, I sprained my bad ankle again, and I thought "She will be really mad". I am more worried about what she could feel than my own injury. However, I think that sometimes I am selfish and mean, in some way, to her. I said things such as "would you take care of me if you were here?", "I want you to be here", or sometimes I don't want her to go to sleep even when I know she has to.  
Maybe, it is because I want to be with her as much as I can, but I was thinking that maybe loving someone and wanting to be with that person all the time means to be selfish in some way or another.

I want her to be happy, even if it is not with me and I don't want her to feel that I put boundaries. I always say that me and her have our own paths, and we have decided to cross them. I think it is like as you were riding a bike. I have my bike, she have her bike and we decided to ride along the same road, but we don't ride the same bike at the same time. 

I love her, I want to be with her forever, and I want her to be free also. I feel free in this relation, and I think that she thinks the same. 

You make me really happy! I could be me with you.
