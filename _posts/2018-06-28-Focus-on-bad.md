* He said I wasn’t special to him (this one hurt a lot).
I still think he’s special to me, but the whole relationship kind of lost its *magic* with that. I also don't wanna ask him about other things because I fear the answer.
*He hasn’t written in this blog in 3 months. 
He may have nothing else to say.
* We haven’t videochatted in more than a month.
He said it was because we didn't have the time, but that's a lie.
* When I ask for something (photos, videos, favor), his first answer is usually “no”.
I sometimes have to insist. I think he likes being in “control”.
* I complain a lot (this post is an example).
Well, that.
* He’s much more sociable than I am. 
He likes to go out and drink and talk much more often. Not a bad thing itself, but a big difference between us.
