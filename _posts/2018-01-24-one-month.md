It's been 4 months apart and now we have only one month to go before we can be together again. At least for another month. 
Since the beginning of this year, things have changed, not for better. I think distance and time have had a strong impact on our relationship. This makes me wonder _would we survive more time apart?_ say, a whole year. 

I am afraid of our relationship not being strong enough, but at the same time, I want it to be really strong, so I know I don't have to let that fear get the better of me.

I still feel that I love him, I still feel I want to spend the rest of my life with him, and I'm still having the same fears as before.
I'm happy and grateful for having met him, and I definitely think that our relationship is overall positive and definitely what I want.

Te amo.
