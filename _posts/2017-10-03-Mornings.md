I wake up with him in my mind, and I reach for the phone because I know there's something for me there. And there ir is: a text, a meme, a song, a photo, a kiss, a hug, I'll take any of those; they come from him.
We usually talk in the mornings (my morning and his morning), we catch up a bit, we say how much we love each other and what we'll do with our days. I feel how much I love him and so begin my day.

His morning is my night. My late night. I wait for the moment he wakes up so I get to talk to him. I'm sleepy and tired. And I like going to bed having talked at least a little with him. 
My morning is his afternoon. I wake up to read about what he has done and I like to start my day knowing that he's doing well.

I like this. I like that we, somehow or other, begin our days together. And we go to sleep together as well. My going to bed is his waking up; his going to bed is my lunch. So we get to say "Good morning" and "Good night". And that is very soothing to me.
I like waking up and going to bed with you, really far away but nonetheless by my side. 

II love you.
