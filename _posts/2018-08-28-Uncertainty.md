He will come in a month. And then, we'll see.
We've been talking about wether we would stay together or not. I've been having doubts, he's been having doubts. Right now, we don't know.

I feel that I want to be with him, but I also feel uncertain. 
He's still in my thoughts every day. 
I think about him first thing in the morning and last thing (along with some stupid shit I like to think about :P )at night. I remember his face, his smile, his voice, his touch. I remember it all.
And I miss him. Not as much as I used to, but I do.
And I'm ready for whatever outcome, but I really hope we stay together, and be happy together, as we intended to.

Distance is a bitch.
