I didn't write to him yesterday.

I'm talking about my daily notes. I felt like I wanted to write but I was in the middle of something else and then I just started to feel really tired and sleepy. And the whole time I felt as if I should write. And then it was late and I really needed to sleep but couldn't. And I still felt I should have written. And then I spent almost 3 hours not sleeping but trying to. He was already awake. And I felt I could have used that time to do some stuff, including writing. I decided not to think about that because I was tired and sleepy and a bit cranky. So I finally got to sleep when everything turned silent around midnight and woke up 5 hours later thinking about 2 things:

It's a really good thing, a plus if not a fundamental obour relationship that we both share a sleeping pattern. Here where I am, I can't sleep sometimes because the guys stay late up night and sometimes make too much noise for me. I'm not one of those who can sleep anywhere an under any conditions. I usually need silence and darkness. I've thought many times about getting used to other conditions, but I've read that quiet and darkness let you sleep better anyway. So, here is where I think our life together would be so good. Sleeping early, waking up early to train. He also tried to help me sleep by calling yesterday, but poor internet connection didn't let him do much. I still found his voice soothing and the fact that he tried made me feel he really cared about me. And that is a plus, but what if he hadn't been in the mood or really never felt like dealing with my issue? Then it gets to my second thought;
I sometimes feel I have obligations that I don't. Yesterday, when I was coming home, I felt as if my not writing was some kind of breach in the contract, about the 'everyday noted’ clause. But we don't have one of those. I don't have that obligation. It just feels as if it's something I should do but I know it's accessory. So I thought about how many of the things we do should be consider necessary and how many accessory. I think most of the things we do are not really obligations but only things we feel like doing for or to the other. We don't feel forced to say “I love you” when we chat, or to tell each other about our day. And I think we haven't even considered not doing so. So those are the basics. Then, what about videochat? We've skipped that a few times, so we do consider not doing it, but it's still not an obligation, we do it because we want to. I think the same applies to photo sharing and anime/movie watching. So, what things do we feel compelled to do and would be “wrong” not to? Are there any? Are there supposed to be any? And then, it's counterpart: are we entitled to anything?

I wil think more about the second. In the meantime, I'm really happy about the first and think it makes it all good.

Te amo.
